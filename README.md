Data Service for Motion Data

There are two kinds of motion datasets, motion skeleton data by MoCap devices and RGBD facial expression data by laser scanners or MS Kinects. The goal of data service is to annotate these raw datasets by manual. The file-"Metadata of Motion data", gives the spec of annotation for reference. The resulting metadata will be regarded as the ground truth for research purposes. The motion data associated with metadata will be published in an OPEN ACCESS way. Currently, there have been around 100M files of motion skeleton data, and 400M RGBD data (including point cloud sequences and image sequences), which are raw data. However, as the raw database is being enlarged, annotators are required to deal with the new added data as well as the current datasets. Moreover, the spec of annotation described in the attachment will be modified as appropriate in future. Hence, annotators are required to deal with the data according to the latest version of spec. All the data are stored in Open source platform, GitHub and our project website. Annotators will work on these websites, and they are required to maintain these websites as well. The annotators are required to deliver the metadata files according to the project contact requests. All the action should follow the file-“BU Standard Conditions of Purchase”.
